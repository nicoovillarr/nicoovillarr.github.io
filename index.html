            Hello, my name is Nicolás Villar. I'm from Uruguay. When I was 10 years old, I started to get insterested in game making. 
            So I downloaded Game Maker Studio. Once I noticed about programming (and I realised Game Maker Studio is not about coding) 
            I downloaded Unity 3D when I was 14. With Unity I learned JavaScript and very few things about .NET because I wanted to 
            create my game's launcher. After that, JavaScript gets deprecated in Unity so I had to learn C#. 
            When I was 17 I started a bigger project related to mobile applications. I learned Java with Android Studio. 
            Then I countinued the project in iOS with XCode using Swift 4. Lastly I did the web application which you can 
            see it in https://haynoche.net/ (unfortunately is not in english) using HTML, JavaScript, CSS and PHP. Now I'm 
            studying Software Engineer at Universidad de la Republica here in Uruguay and also I'm working at Inetsat SA as 
            full-stack developer where I use C# and .NET Framework.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="medium-title">Mission</h2>
        <p>
            In my freetime I like to create new things. A big part of my coding life was being helped by other programmers or libraries
            which made my life easier. Now I want to be on the other side and help other people with things I do. Newbie or not,
            I'm sure I can help someone who is at the same place I was.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mission here is to show people what I create but also teach something in order to feed you couriosity.
        </p>
